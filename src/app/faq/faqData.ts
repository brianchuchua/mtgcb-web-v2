      answer: `
        <p>All card prices are sourced directly from <strong>TCGPlayer</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The site displays market prices by default, which represent a fair selling price of cards. 
        This gives you a realistic estimate of what your cards are worth in the current market, 
        although you can change which price to use in your account settings.</p>

        <p>Prices are updated <strong>every 24 hours</strong>.</p>
        <p>You can see when a card's price was last updated on its card page.</p>

    {
      question: 'Why are some cards missing prices or have incorrect prices?',
      answer: `
        <p>That card may not yet be linked up to TCGPlayer, or it's so low-volume that there are 
        none up for sale on TCGPlayer, or a vendor made a typo in TCGPlayer.</p>

        <p>These issues usually clear up every 24 hours, but if you see a persistent one, reach out to me.</p>

      answer: `
        <p>It's probably on my TODO list to add. I'm pretty good about adding new cards before or on 
        release dates, but there is backlog of miscellaneous cards to support, not to mention the 
        eventual project to support all language printings of all cards.</p>

        <p>Feel free to contact me if a particular set or card is important to you. I can update you 
        on its status.</p>

      answer: `
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Brian</strong>! Although you may see me as <strong>Manath</strong> on Discord or on MTG Arena. I'm a software engineer.</p>

        <p>I developed the original <strong>MTG Collection Builder</strong> in college after being inspired by MTG Studio, 
        the app I used at the time, but wishing that I could see progress bars for my collection and its value.</p>

        <p>I also wanted to be able to press a button to automatically add to cart any cards I was missing 
        for a specific set -- and to know how much that would cost me.</p>

        <p>I had fun using it, although the first version didn't even have an account system, just input spreadsheet -> get an output. As part of giving me access to their data, TCGPlayer put a little link to the site on their site menu.</p>

        <p>To my surprise, I started getting users! And emails politely asking for basic features, and it eventually blossomed to a full-fledged side project.</p>

        <p>It's grown a lot since then, and after three full rewrites of the platform, I'm happy to <em>finally</em> release this new-and-improved version.</p>

        <p>Don't be shy about reaching out if you have feedback or need anything. There's an infinite number of features I can add, and even though I'm just a solo developer, I do want to hear what you'd like to see.</p>

        <p>Happy collecting!</p>

      question: `What is the best Magic format?`,
      answer: `<p><s>There isn't a definitive answer to this question since it all depends on personal preference and--</s></p><p>Just kidding, it's Booster Draft.</p><p>Speaking more seriously, it's a format where you get to collect <em>and</em> play at the same time, build different decks, and where more cards are playable than any constructed format. And the experience changes every few months! And you can sometimes make a profit with prizing or a lucky pull!</p>`,
