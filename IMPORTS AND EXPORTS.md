## Import/Export Research

- TODO: Need to add a notes field explaining any special steps.
- TODO: May need to let user specify price preference, or use the site one.
- TODO: Top-down testing of each method and auditing of default and sample fields.
- TODO: I should have a generic handler that can receive a hierarchy of fields and do its best to map them one step at a time.
- TODO: Just like I label unsupported formats, I should label formats that are not accurate due to no unique identifier. It's not my fault! maybe good and bad levels of support labels. I put so much pressure on myself to get it right, but I can't control the data from other sites. Explain in an info note why the support is not perfect.
- TODO: I should force the user to include set name and card name and set code to help them with errors.

- No unique field unfortunately, but Archidekt lets me do scryfallId, so since Moxfield lets you import Archidekt, I may be able to cross-reference the two to create a mapping.
- How do they support so many import formats? Do they really? I'll need to cross-test these.
- Maybe all these sites fail importing when there are naming differences and categorization differences?

- Have to pay to import and their import formats may be limited, unless I check out their supported ones.

### Deckbox.org

- Status: ‚úÖDone
- They support exporting scryfall id and tcgplayer id, but do not use them for importing.
- Out of 44000 cards, 43500 are recognized and it splits successes from failures into two files.
- But trying the actual import just spins. Not sure if it's going to fail after a few minutes.
- I force-closed and refreshed, then saw my cards.
- Need to tell the user when exporting in deckbox format to use the "Deckbox CSV" section under Add Cards.
- Their site times out with 44000 cards after 1 minute, the spinner forever spinning.
- But they all made it.

TODO: Must unify the logic for identifying cards across all import formats.
