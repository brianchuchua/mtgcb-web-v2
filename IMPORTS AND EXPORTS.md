## Import/Export Research

- TODO: Need to add a notes field explaining any special steps.
- TODO: May need to let user specify price preference, or use the site one.

### TCGPlayer app

- Users need to change the Default share format to CSV in the app settings.
- They'll want to have all the CSV fields enabled in the CSV output settings.
- The app by default names the file a .txt even though the data is in CSV format.
- It's buggy and doesn't actually work for importing back into the app.
- Import: Done
- Export: Not Supported
