# TODOs

## Now

- Integrate Playwright and Jest and React Testing Library -- skip the darn snapshot tests, though. Those never help me.
- Start porting over mtgcb-web to this project, using the latest React best practices

## Later

- Clean up this README
- Sentry integration
- Performance testing

## UX Thoughts

- How to best handle filters and searching on mobile? How do other tools do it?
- Let's make UX changes as we port components over.
- Need a main landing page that doesn't suck. It needs a large call-to-action to register and show off the features of the site.
